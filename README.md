# Jekyll New Post

A small extension for [Atom] that gives you a dialog box for creating new jekyll posts.

Hit `Cmd+Alt+J` and give your post a title e.g. "My Awesome new Post!" `jekyll-new-post` will then create and open `_posts/2014-03-31-my-awesome-new-post.markdown` with a few variables set at the top of the page (like `layout`).
